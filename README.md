* Open the project in your IDE. You can copy URL this repository or download it as zip.
* Configure Tomcat:
    * add artifact internetshop:war exploded;
    * add Java SDK (prefer version 11 or higher)

* At src/main/java/mate/academy/internetshop/factory/Factory.java class use username and password for your database to create a Connection.
* Change a path in src/main/java/resources/log4j.properties to properly write logs on the disc.

If you want to try default implementation (with Java Collections Framework) just change in 
src/main/mate/academy/internetshop/factory/Factory next rows:
* 79 - BucketDaoJdbcImpl(connection) to <b>BucketDaoImpl()</b>
* 86 - ItemDaoJdbcImpl(connection) to <b>ItemDaoImpl()</b>
* 93 - OrderDaoJdbcImpl(connection) to <b>OrderDaoImpl()</b>
* 100 - UserDaoJdbcImpl(connection) to <b>UserDaoImpl</b>

Later, when project has been started click <b>"Click to create users"</b> button. Then you'll have two users: 
* First one with login "Mike" and password "123" has role "user"
* Second one with login "John" and password "321" has role "admin"
